### What I learned

You can change the color of your images using the filter property. Filters applies graphical effects like blur or color shift to an element

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<img src="./images/icon-share.svg" />
```

```css
img {
  filter: brightness(0) invert(1);
}
```
