## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

You cannot use CSS ::after on the image tag because img is a void element and its content model never allows it to have contents under any circumstances. Insteag i used a picture tag which is more flexibile and helps with responsive images.
